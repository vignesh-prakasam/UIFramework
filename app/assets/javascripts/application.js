 This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
 listed below.

 Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
 or vendor/assets/javascripts of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.

 It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
 compiled file.

 Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
 about supported directives.
